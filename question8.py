'''Harry & Meghan were playing a game. Harry gave Meghan a number N, and asked her to multiply it by 3, 
and then add 7 to it, and then finally subtract 10 from it. Since Meghan is very weak in Math, 
help her win the game by finding the final value of N.'''

n=int(input("Enter your number : "))
num=((n*3)+7)-10
